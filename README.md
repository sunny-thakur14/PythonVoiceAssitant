# PythonVoiceAssitant
In this project we have to speak in microphone and code will accept our voice as input and gives us output. For example If I say 'open youtube' the code will open the youtube
When you say 'stop' the assistant will stop otherwise it will keep on taking your inputs i the voice form.
